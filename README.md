Description
=====================

A simple MegaMan 2 style endurance platformer, written in AS3 with Adobe Flash.

The game itself is a standard inheritance based game, made in the span of about 3 weeks. Don't expect anything too special archeticture-wise.



Requirements
============

Due to the .fla library being a prominent feature of the game's design, a version of Adobe Flash will be needed to compile the game in its current state.

Keep in mind the .fla doesn't contain any actionscript, but the contents of the library contain animations and movieclips that some entities get tied to on compile.
